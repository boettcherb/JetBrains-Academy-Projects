# Bill Splitter

### About this project
Everyone likes eating out with friends. The more friends, the better, but the bill time is always a bummer, to say the least. Why not develop a tool to keep the fun alive and make sure that everyone pays an equal amount.

### Learning Outcomes
Work on your Python basics and take a look at more advanced data structures such as dictionaries. Develop an app for managing expenses during your next dine-out.

### Run

Requirements:
- Python 3.9
`python billsplitter.py`

# Code it yourself:

## 1. Invite Your Friends

### Description

You have planned a dinner with your friends today. It's the right time to add them to your program. You need to be sure how many friends are joining you for dinner including you.

The idea is to take names from user input. Store them in a dictionary.

For example, if five friends are joining including you, you need to add five people to the dictionary so that you can access/update the corresponding bill value later.

### Objective

In this stage your program should perform the following steps:

1. Take user input â€” how many people want to join, including the user;
2. In case of an invalid number of people (zero or negative), `"No one is joining for the party"` is expected as an output;
3. Otherwise, take the friends' names as input, iteratively;
4. Store them in a dictionary initialized with zeros;
5. Print out the dictionary.

To communicate with the user, please use the prompts specified in the examples. Note that here and in the following stages we expect you to take every input in a new line.

### Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1: Valid input
```
Enter the number of friends joining (including you):
> 5

Enter the name of every friend (including you), each on a new line:
> Marc
> Jem
> Monica
> Anna
> Jason

{'Marc': 0, 'Jem': 0, 'Monica': 0, 'Anna': 0, 'Jason': 0}
```
Example 2: Invalid input
```
Enter the number of friends joining (including you):
> 0

No one is joining for the party
```

## 2. The Bill has Arrived

### Description

It's bill time! Let's split the bill among everyone and update the values in the dictionary you have created in the previous stage.

Since we don't want to deal with too many decimals (who carries that much change anyway?), round up the split amount to two decimal places and then update the dictionary with the split values.

### Objective

In this stage your program should perform the following steps together with the steps of the previous stage:

1. If there are no people to split the bill (the number of friends is 0 or an invalid input), output `"No one is joining for the party"`;
2. Else, take user input: the final bill;
3. Split the total bill equally among everyone;
4. Round up the split value to two decimal places;
5. Update the dictionary with the split values;
6. Print the updated dictionary.

Do not print the output of the previous stage (see examples).

### Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1: Five people joining
```
Enter the number of friends joining (including you):
> 5

Enter the name of every friend (including you), each on a new line:
> Marc
> Jem
> Monica
> Anna
> Jason

Enter the total bill value:
> 100

{'Marc': 20, 'Jem': 20, 'Monica': 20, 'Anna': 20, 'Jason': 20}
```
Example 2: Seven people joining
```
Enter the number of friends joining (including you):
> 7

Enter the name of every friend (including you), each on a new line:
> Marc
> Jem
> Monica
> Anna
> Jason
> Ben
> Ned

Enter the total bill value:
> 41

{'Marc': 5.86, 'Jem': 5.86, 'Monica':5.86, 'Anna': 5.86, 'Jason': 5.86, 'Ben': 5.86, 'Ned': 5.86}
```
Example 3: Invalid input
```
Enter the number of friends joining (including you):
> 0

No one is joining for the party
```
