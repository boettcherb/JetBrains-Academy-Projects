# Chatty Bot

### About this project
Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!

### Learning Outcomes
You'll get to know the basic syntax of Python and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and functions.

### Run

Requirements:
- Python 3.9
`python chattybot.py`

# Code it yourself: 

## 1. Chatty Bot Welcomes You
### Description

Digital personal assistants help people to drive cars, plan their day, buy something online. In a sense, they are simplified versions of artificial intelligence with whom you can talk.

In this project, you will develop step by step a simple bot that will help you study programming.

### Objective

For the first stage, you will write a bot who displays a greeting, its name, and the date of its creation. First impressions count!

Your program should print the following lines:

```
Hello! My name is {bot_name}.
I was created in {birth_year}.
```

Instead of `{bot_name}`, print any name you choose and replace `{birth_year}` with the current year (four digits).

### Example

Output:

```
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
```

You can change the text if you want but print exactly two lines.

Next, we will use Aid and 2020 as your bot's name and its birth year, but you can change it if you need to.
