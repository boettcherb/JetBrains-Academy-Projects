# Chatty Bot

### About this project
Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!

### Learning Outcomes
You'll get to know the basic syntax of Python and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and functions.

### Run

Requirements:
- Python 3.9
`python chattybot.py`

# Code it yourself: 

## 1. Chatty Bot Welcomes You
### Description

Digital personal assistants help people to drive cars, plan their day, buy something online. In a sense, they are simplified versions of artificial intelligence with whom you can talk.

In this project, you will develop step by step a simple bot that will help you study programming.

### Objective

For the first stage, you will write a bot who displays a greeting, its name, and the date of its creation. First impressions count!

Your program should print the following lines:

```
Hello! My name is {bot_name}.
I was created in {birth_year}.
```

Instead of `{bot_name}`, print any name you choose and replace `{birth_year}` with the current year (four digits).

### Example

Output:

```
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
```

You can change the text if you want but print exactly two lines.

Next, we will use Aid and 2020 as your bot's name and its birth year, but you can change it if you need to.

## 2. Print your name
### Description

The greeting part is great, but chatbots are also supposed to interact with a user. It's time to implement this functionality.

### Objective

At this stage, you will introduce yourself to the bot so that it can greet you by your name.

Your program should print the following lines:

```
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
Please, remind me your name.
What a great name you have, {your_name}!
```

You may change the name and the creation year of your bot if you want.

Instead of `{your_name}`, the bot must print your name entered from the standard input.

### Example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1: a dialogue with the bot
```
Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2020.
Please, remind me your name.
> Max
What a great name you have, Max!
```
Use the provided template to simplify your work. You can change the text, but not the number of printed lines.
