# Currency Converter

### About this project
Want to convert one currency to another? You can go to your bank website and do the math by yourself. Or you can write a program to do it quickly and efficiently! The Currency Converter is a simple console program that calculates the amount of money you get by converting one currency to another.

### Learning Outcomes
You will learn many concepts of Python — basic types, variables, arithmetic operations, loops, and working with files. Get a taste of more advanced features — JSON format, caching, and how to work with the network. You will write a currency converter program that uses a third-party service.

### Run

Requirements:
- Python 3.9
`python currencyconverter.py`

# Code it yourself:

## 1. Cryptocurrencies are the New Black

But we need to start easy, so for now, all you need to do is to print "Meet a conicoin!" Please, make sure that the output formatting of your program follows the example output formatting.

### Objective
