# Memorization Tool

### About this project
It would be great to remember anything at any time. Alas, our mental capacity is limited. The good thing is that there are a lot of tools to help us memorize things. In this project, we are going to create a tool for memorizing lines, poems, speeches, and other text-based materials.

### Learning Outcomes
Work with the SQLAlchemy ORM and an SQLite database to create a tool for memorizing. Practice loops, lists, and various string methods.

### Run

Requirements:
- Python 3.9
`python memorizationtool.py`

# Code it yourself:

## 1. Make Your Own Flashcards

### Description

A good memorizing tool can boost your short and long-term memory. If you tried to learn a foreign language, you probably know what a flashcard is. It is an excellent device to remember facts. Flashcards alone are not enough, we need a special technique.

Let's create our flashcards first. A flashcard is a piece of paper with a question on one side and the answer on the other. Let's assume we need to memorize the capital cities of various countries. Write the country name on one side and the capital on the other.

### Objectives

In this stage, we need to create our first flashcards.
When the program starts, it should print the menu below. It is our main menu (1):
```
1. Add flashcards
2. Practice flashcards
3. Exit
```
If `1` is entered, the program should print the following sub-menu (2):
```
1. Add a new flashcard
2. Exit
```
By choosing the `Add a new flashcard` option, a user is prompted to enter a `Question` and an `Answer`. Once they are entered, the program automatically returns to the sub-menu (2). Iterate this process every time a user wants to add a new flashcard.

**Flashcard practice:**

The `Practice flashcards` option in the main menu (1) should print all the questions and answers that have been added previously. If there are no flashcards, print `There is no flashcard to practice!` and return to the main menu (1).

Your flashcard should appear on the screen in the following way:
```
Question: {your question}
Please press "y" to see the answer or press "n" to skip:
```
If `y` is entered, the program should output `Answer: {your answer}` and go to the next flashcard. If there are no flashcards to show, return to the main menu (1).

If `n` is entered, skip to the next flashcard. If there are no flashcards to show, return to the main menu (1).

Once the program has reached the end of a flashcard list, return to the main menu (1).

Please keep in mind the following:

- In case of the wrong input, output the following message: `{wrong key} is not an option`. Wait for the right input.
- Your questions and answers must be non-empty values. Otherwise, wait for the input.
- Don't forget about the goodbye message. Output `Bye!` every time a user exits the program.

### Examples

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

## 1. Store the Flashcards

### Description

In the previous stage, we created our first flashcards. The downside is that they are lost every time you close the program. We need to find a way to store them. We can use an SQLite database for this purpose. This database consists of a single file and is easy to install. To process this type of database with Python rather than SQL, we need Object Relational Mapper (ORM). SQLAlchemy can translate the Python classes to tables in relational databases and convert the function calls to SQL statements automatically.

### Theory

Theory

When establishing a connection with the database, you should add a `check_same_thread=False` flag to the database name so that Hyperskill can test your project properly
```
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///<your database name.db>?check_same_thread=False')
```
After that, we need to create tables in the database so that the `declarative_base()` function can establish a base class. A base class stores a catalog of classes and mapped tables in the declarative system.
```
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
Base = declarative_base()
```
Once the base class is declared, we can define any number of mapped classes inside. For now, we want to store the answers and questions in the database. To do that we need to define the following class:
```
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String

class MyClass(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'my_table'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    first_column = Column(String)
    second_column = Column(String)
```
A class in declarative must have a `__tablename__` attribute and at least one `Column` that constitutes a primary key.

We also need to call the `MetaData.create_all()` method to create the corresponding table in the database.
```
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```
Now, you should create a session. And, finally, you are ready to add a new object to the table:
```
new_data = MyClass(first_column='What is the capital city of India', second_column='New Delhi')
session.add(new_data)
session.commit()
```
The added data will be pending until we call the `commit()` method.

The `query(<mapped class name>)` method can help you access the table data.
```
result_list = session.query(MyClass).all()
```
This code snippet above includes the `all()` method that returns a list of all added objects.
```
print(result_list[0].question)  # What is the capital city of India
print(result_list[0].answer)    # New Delhi
print(result_list[0].id)        # 1
```

### Objectives

In this stage, your program should implement the features from Stage 1 and do the following:

1. Create a database. Please, name it `flashcard`: this will ensure the proper work of the tests (even though the tests will not check the file with the database itself).
1. Create a table in the database, name it `flashcard`.
1. Store a question in each table row with an answer and an ID.
