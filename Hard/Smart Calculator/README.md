# Smart Calculator

### About this project
Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. Why not create one yourself, and make it really special? In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember your previous calculations.

### Learning Outcomes
Apart from writing a useful program (everyone uses calculators!), you will learn a lot about lists, strings and dictionaries. You will also get closer experience with 2 important data structures: the stack and the queue.

### Run

Requirements:
- Python 3.9
`python smartcalculator.py`

# Code it yourself:

## 1. 2+2

### Description

Your task is to make a smart calculator. What do you usually expect from a calculator? Of course, it is bound to support 4 basic operations: multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. But we don't stop there and add the ability to calculate expressions containing parenthesis and the ability to remember the previous result. This will be a console application, which you will improve gradually, from simple to complex.
So, the first version of the calculator will only support the addition operation for two numbers. In this version, you will not receive the plus symbol (+) as an input, you will accept this as an unwritten rule (because only one operation is supported).

### Objectives

Write a program that reads two integer numbers from the same line and prints their sum in the standard output. Numbers can be positive, negative, or zero.

### Example

The example below shows the input and the corresponding output. Your program should work in the same way. Do not add extra characters after the output!

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.
