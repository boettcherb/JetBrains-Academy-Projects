# Coffee Machine

### About this project
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

### Learning Outcomes
This project allows you to get a taste of Python. Practice working with functions, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident in Python.

### Run

Requirements:
- Python 3.9
`python coffeemachine.py`

# Code it yourself: 

## 1. Making Coffee
### Description

Let's start with a program that makes you a coffee – virtual coffee, of course. In this project, you will implement functionality that simulates a real coffee machine. It can run out of ingredients, such as milk or coffee beans, it can offer you various types of coffee, and, finally, it will take money for the prepared drink.

### Objective

The first version of the program just makes you a coffee. It should print to the standard output what it is doing as it makes the drink.

### Example

Take a look at the sample output below and print all the following lines.

Output:

```
Starting to make a coffee
Grinding coffee beans
Boiling water
Mixing boiled water with crushed coffee beans
Pouring coffee into the cup
Pouring some milk into the cup
Coffee is ready!
```
