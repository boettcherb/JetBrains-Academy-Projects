# Markdown Editor

### About this project
Markdown is a special plain text formatting language that is extremely popular among developers. It is used in documents, research articles, Github README files, and other things. In this project, you will write an editor that will be able to recognize several tags, structures, and save your results to a file.

### Learning Outcomes
Practice list operations, file handling, functions, scopes, and a lot of other things. Make a handy and useful tool that uses the markdown language!

### Run

Requirements:
- Python 3.9
`python markdowneditor.py`

# Code it yourself:

## 1. Meet the Markdown

### Description

Welcome to the first stage of the project!

If you have worked with the markdown, you will probably recognize the following syntax:
```
# The Beatles
One may say that they were the most famous **rock band** ever.
The legendary **line-up** comprised the following people:
* *John Lennon*
* *Paul McCartney*
* *George Harrison*
* *Ringo Starr*
```
Yes! It is a raw markdown code. It translates into:

# The Beatles
One may say that they were the most famous **rock band** ever.
The legendary **line-up** comprised the following people:
* *John Lennon*
* *Paul McCartney*
* *George Harrison*
* *Ringo Starr*

### Objectives

Determine and print the source (raw) markdown code of the markdown snippet below. Show your understanding of the syntax basics. You can use the Markdown Guide as it covers all the necessary topics.

Below is the snippet to complete this stage. Once you write it in the markdown syntax, put it into triple quotes and print it:

# John Lennon

or ***John Winston Ono Lennon**** was one of *The Beatles*.
Here are the songs he wrote I like the most:

* Imagine
* Norwegian Wood
* Come Together
* In My Life
* ~~Hey Jude~~ (that was *McCartney*)
