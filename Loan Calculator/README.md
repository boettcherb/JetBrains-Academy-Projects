# Loan Calculator

### About this project
Personal finances are an important part of life. Sometimes you need some extra money and decide to take a loan, or you want to buy a house using a mortgage. To make an informed decision, you need to be able to calculate different financial parameters. Letâ€™s make a program that can help us with that!

### Learning Outcomes
You will practice using mathematics and Python in everyday tasks and learn how to use third-party modules and libraries. You will also learn more about different financial instruments.

### Run

Requirements:
- Python 3.9
`python loancalculator.py`

# Code it yourself:

## 1. Beginning

### Description

Let's think about what a loan calculator should be able to do. In general, it takes several parameters like a loan principal and interest, calculates the values the user wants to know (for example, monthly payment or overpayment), and outputs them to the user.

Not familiar with these concepts? Don't worry, we will explain them to you in simple terms. The principal is the original amount of money you borrow. The interest is a charge for borrowing that money, usually calculated as a percentage of the principal amount.

### Objective

Let's start by imitating this behavior. There are some prepared variables in the source code: these are text messages that our loan calculator can output. In this stage, all you need to do is output them in the right order.

### Example

Output:
```
Loan principal: 1000
Month 1: repaid 250
Month 2: repaid 250
Month 3: repaid 500
The loan has been repaid!
```
